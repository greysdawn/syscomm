## FAQ

### Who's this for? What are systems?
A system is a person that shares their body with many others. Often this is the result of having a dissociative disorder like DID, but people that aren't diagnosed and have headmates are also systems.

### Hi, I'm not a system. Can I still use this?
Of course! It's not meant just for systems, but just know that this was made with systems in mind.

### So how do I use it?
Simple :3

Go over to the releases, download the latest one. Unzip it, and run the Syscomm.exe file. There you go!

### Where is data stored?
It depends on your system (no pun intended), but data is usually stored in your appdata folder under `/LOVE/Syscomm`. On Windows, that'd look something like `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\Syscomm`
